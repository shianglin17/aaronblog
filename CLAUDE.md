## <software_engineering_principles>
### Core Design Principles
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prioritize simplicity over complexity. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication. Extract common functionality into reusable components or utilities.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't implement features until they're actually needed. Avoid over-engineering.
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility: Each class/function should have one reason to change
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
  - Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Divide code into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern.
- **Principle of Least Surprise**: Code should behave in ways that are predictable and intuitive.

### State Management Guidelines
- **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative data source for each piece of state.
- **Predictable State Updates**: State changes should be explicit and traceable.
- **Minimal State**: Keep only the minimal state necessary; derive everything else through computed properties.

### Testing Principles
- **Reality-Based Testing**: All tests must reflect actual API functionality. Never create tests for non-existent features or endpoints.
- **API-First Testing**: Test logic should be derived from real API routes and controller methods, not imagined functionality.
- **Test-to-Reality Mapping**: Before writing any test, verify the corresponding API endpoint exists and functions as expected.
- **Avoid Phantom Features**: Do not test batch operations, admin features, or complex workflows unless they are explicitly implemented in the codebase.
- **Data Structure Validation**: Ensure test assertions match actual API response structures, including required fields like `articles_count`.
- **Business Logic Accuracy**: Test constraints and validation rules must match the actual service layer implementation (e.g., loose vs strict deletion policies).

### API Documentation Standards (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **Truth to Implementation**: API documentation must 100% reflect actual code implementation. Never document non-existent features or endpoints.
- **Route Accuracy**: All `@OA\` path annotations must match actual routes in `routes/api.php` exactly.
- **HTTP Method Consistency**: Use correct HTTP methods (`@OA\Get`, `@OA\Post`, `@OA\Put`, `@OA\Delete`) that match the actual route definitions.
- **Parameter Validation Sync**: All `@OA\Parameter` and `@OA\RequestBody` specifications must match the actual FormRequest validation rules exactly.
- **Response Structure Fidelity**: All `@OA\Response` schemas must match actual API response structures from Transformers and ApiResponse classes.
- **Status Code Accuracy**: Document only HTTP status codes that the API actually returns. Check Controller and Exception handling code.
- **Security Scheme Reality**: Authentication/authorization schemes in documentation must match actual middleware implementations.
- **Required vs Optional Fields**: Field requirements in documentation must match actual validation rules (required, sometimes, nullable).
- **Example Data Consistency**: All example values should be realistic and consistent across related endpoints.
- **Error Response Completeness**: Document all possible error responses including validation errors, authentication failures, and business logic exceptions.
- **Versioning Alignment**: API documentation version must align with actual API implementation version.
- **Before Documentation**: Always examine the actual Controller, FormRequest, Service, and Transformer classes before writing any OpenAPI annotations.
</software_engineering_principles>

## <guidelines>
- Always confirm ambiguous requirements before proceeding.
- Prefer modular, testable, reusable code or designs.
- Provide deliverables in expected formats (e.g., JSON schema, Figma-like layout, YAML pipeline).
- When relevant, include diagrams, test cases, or CLI-ready commands.
- Clarify tradeoffs if decisions affect performance, cost, UX, or security.
- **Package Usage Rules**: Before using any new packages or frameworks, check existing package.json or dependency files to confirm version compatibility and usage patterns. Avoid introducing unverified package versions.
- **Frontend Performance Priority**: All frontend modifications must consider performance impact. Avoid excessive CSS animations, complex gradients, and multiple shadow effects. Prioritize transform and opacity for animations to avoid layout thrashing. Check performance metrics after each modification to ensure no significant degradation in page load speed and runtime performance.
- **Design System Consistency**: Use unified design tokens to manage colors, spacing, shadows, and other visual elements. All UI components should follow consistent design specifications:
  - CSS custom properties for color systems (primary, secondary, surface, text)
  - Standardized shadow levels (shadow-xs, shadow-sm, shadow-md, shadow-lg, shadow-xl)
  - Consistent transition effects (transition-fast, transition-normal, transition-slow)
  - Uniform interaction states (hover, active, focus) and visual feedback
- **State Management Strategy**: For Pinia stores, follow the KISS principle. Use simple caching strategies without TTL unless specifically required. Implement manual refresh mechanisms instead of automatic expiration to maintain code simplicity.
- **Git Commit Standards**: Do not include Claude-generated signatures or co-authored messages in commits. Keep commit messages clean and focused on the actual changes being made.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.2.28
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- vue (VUE) - v3


## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] <name>` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== phpunit/core rules ===

## PHPUnit Core

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit <name>` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files, these are core to the application.

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).


=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.
